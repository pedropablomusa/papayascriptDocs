                <p>PapayaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), PapayaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.</p>
                <p>PapayaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core PapayaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                          Client-side PapayaScript extends the core language by supplying
                          objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                          For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                          elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                          clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Server-side PapayaScript extends the core language by supplying
                          objects relevant to running PapayaScript on a server. For example,
                          server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                          database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                          another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                          server.
                        </li>

            <header>The name PapayaScript</header>
            <article>
                <p>PapayaScript and Papaya are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                    different in some others. The PapayaScript language resembles Papaya but
                    does not have Papaya's static typing and strong type checking.
                    PapayaScript follows most Papaya expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to PapayaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Papaya's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, PapayaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. PapayaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. PapayaScript also supports functions without
                    any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>PapayaScript is a very free-form language compared to Papaya. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                    to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <article>
                <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                A PapayaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because PapayaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>
              You can declare a variable in three ways:
              <p>
                With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
                syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
              </p>
              <p>
                By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
                syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
                Variable scope below.
              </p>

            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                function.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
                example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
                function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                block, which in this case is an if statement.
              </p>
              <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
              <p>
                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                ECMAScript 2015.
              </p>
    
              <code
                >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                not defined</code

        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>

                <p>
                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>
                        null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                        JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                        NULL, or any other variant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>
                        Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                        are unique and immutable.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
                you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
                functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
                think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                procedures that your application can perform.
